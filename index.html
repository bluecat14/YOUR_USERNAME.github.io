        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, 
            whisk together dry ingredients 
            (flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt).
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> In a measuring cup, combine
     half and half and apple cider vinegar. 
     Stir few times and let sit 2 to 3 minutes. 
     It should thicken up and half and half should sour.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add egg, oil and vanilla
     to medium bowl or large measuring cup. 
     Whisk until smooth. Add half and half and vinegar mixture. 
     Whisk to combine. Add the wet ingredients and chocolate chips 
     to dry ingredients and stir to combine. Do not overmix. 
     The batter should be slightly lumpy. After few minutes
      (while the griddle pan heats up), the batter will thicken and have bubbles
</p>
     <p><strong>Step 4:</strong>Using an ice cream scoop, 
        scoop the batter (1 scoop per pancake) and fry on one side 
        until bubbles form holes around the edges and towards the center. 
        Flip pancakes and fry on the other side for 10 to 15 seconds.
         I always melt 1 tablespoon of butter on the griddle while it heats up.</p>
     
     
         <p><strong>Step 5:</strong>Serve warm with a slice 
            of butter and drizzle of maple syrup.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Place the chocolate 
            in a heat-proof bowl. Set aside.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Heat the heavy cream until it i
    s simmering. You can heat it on the stove or in the microwave.
</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add the butter, if using, t
        o the chocolate and pour the heavy cream evenly on top. Let th
        e warm cream and chocolate sit for 5 minutes minutes. Add the v
        anilla extract then stir until the chocolate has completely melted.
         Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface (to avoid co
         ndensation) and refrigerate for 1-2 hours. Tip: Pour into a flat shallow 
         dish, such as a 8×8 inch baking pan, so the mixture evenly an
         d quickly sets.
</p>
    <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Scoop the set truffle mixtu
        re into 2 teaspoon-sized mounds. This cookie scoop is
         the perfect size. For larger truffles, 1 Tablespoon si
         ze mounds. Roll each into balls. This gets a little sticky,
          so see my tips above.
</p>
    <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Roll each into toppings, if
         desired. Truffles taste best at room temperature!

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Note: This dough requires chilling.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Place melted 
    butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment 
    (or a large bowl if using a hand mixer). Add granulated and brown sugars
     and mix on low speed until the mixture is smooth. Mix in egg and vanilla 
     extract and mix on medium speed until combined.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Mix in baking soda and salt, then slowly mix in 
        flour and mix just until the batter is smooth and comes together. Be sure 
        to scrape the sides of the bowl during mixing. Slowly mix in chocolate chips.
</p>
    <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Line a cookie sheet with 
        a silicone baking mat or parchment paper. Scoop 2 
        tablespoon balls of dough onto the cookie sheet. 
        Spacing doesn’t matter because you will be chilling
         the dough. Cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 2 hours.
</p>
    <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Preheat oven to 350°F.
         Line a second cookie sheet with parchment pap
         er or a silicone baking mat.
</p>
    <p><strong>Step 6:</strong>Remove the chilled
         cookie dough balls from the refrigerator and space
          them 2-inches apart on the cookie sheets. Bake (2 tablesp
          oon sized cookies) for 11-15 minutes, or until the edges a
          re a light golden and the tops are no longer glossy. 
          Let cool on the
           cookie sheets at least 10 minutes before removing. </p>
